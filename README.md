# Change-making problem

This is a solution implemented in Ruby to two variations of the [change making problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem)

### Coin Change | DP - 7

Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.
For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4. For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. So the output should be 5.

### Minimum change problem

Given a value V, if we want to make a change for V Rs, and we have an infinite supply of each of the denominations in Indian currency, i.e., we have an infinite supply of { 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000} valued coins/notes, what is the minimum number of coins and/or notes needed to make the change?

Examples:

```
Input: V = 70
Output: 2
We need a 50 Rs note and a 20 Rs note.

Input: V = 121
Output: 3
We need a 100 Rs note, a 20 Rs note and a 1 Rs coin.
```
